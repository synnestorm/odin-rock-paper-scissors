# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my first project using JavaScript. The project was initially supposed to be played only via the console (I thought it was difficult to figure out how to do that). You play the game by choosing Rock, Paper or Scissor. You then click the Computer button and see what it generates.

Rules:

- Rock beats Scissor
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissor beats Paper

Let me know if anything could be improved or changed.. or some advice would be appriciated.
